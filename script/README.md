## Master Legacy Lua Scripting Framework

*This repository contains the final version of my Lua scripting framework from my early tooling and reverse‑engineering work in mobile game environments.*

It demonstrates:
- Structured menu systems in Lua (multi‑choice menus, navigation)
- Memory analysis and experimentation
- Custom tool design without standard debugger tools
- Adaptive problem solving under platform constraints

### 📌 Why this script exists

This project was developed on a non‑root Android device, without use of Frida, dump.cs, or offline debug tooling.  
These limitations shaped an alternative approach to scripting, requiring efficient logic, modular design, and creative techniques.

This script marks:
- The culmination of standalone tool development  
- My early architecture for modular scripting  
- A transition point toward larger systems and tooling

## 📂 Structure Overview

Each component explores different aspects:
- UI and interaction patterns  
- Flow control and menu logic  
- Feature modules for memory or state manipulation  

(Lua is designed for embedding and rapid scripting, and this project uses that flexibility heavily.)
