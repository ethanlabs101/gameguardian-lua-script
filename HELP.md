# Help & About

## Purpose
This script is designed to showcase my beginnings with Lua and GameGuardian scripting. It demonstrates:
- Basic memory reading/writing
- Automation of tasks
- Scripting logic for research

## Usage
1. Load _CPMGARAGEULTIMATE.lua in GameGuardian.
2. Follow the prompts or comments inside the script.
3. Use responsibly for research and learning.

## Help
- This script has name protection and update protection heres how to patch for testing ->
- Name protection (located @line 5667) (Here name should work but if you plan to change change this line and rename file accordingly)
- detector = gg.getFile():match('[^/]+$')  
name = "_CPMGARAGEULTIMATE.lua" 

- Update protection (located @line 44) (Change Version number to current for testing)
- -- Define the expected game versions
local expectedGameVersions = { "4.9.4" } -- Add multiple versions
